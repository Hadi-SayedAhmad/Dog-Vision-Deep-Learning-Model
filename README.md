You can find the data set on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

Note: This was a deep learning model. The data that I used was about 10,000+ images, so at the end of the notebook, you may see some cells that I didn't execute because Google Colab has FREE limited resources (GPU) so the time was always expiring when trying to wait for the model to finish training on the full dataset. However, this project was done following a professional advanced AI Engineering course so I followed best practices in terms of workflow, coding, and understanding.
